# A set of terminal tools that helps building apps that look nice on the terminal

This is a simple library for controlling *text* appearance and placement on terminals. 
It provides also an advanced progress bar library.

The main advantages of the progress bar library included here are the
following:

* Easily show multiple progress bars controlled independently
* Control the placement of the bars anyplace on the screen
* Control the appearance of the bars using a simple markup like interface
* When no information about the actual progress is available (which happens
  alot in datascience applications), it is possible to just indicate that the system is not stuck
